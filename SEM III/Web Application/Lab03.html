    <h1>SER ARTHUR DAYNE - THE SWORD OF THE MORNING</h1>
    <p>Ser Arthur Dayne was a legendary knight and one of the finest men to have joined the Kingsguard, probably rivaled
      only by Ser Barristan Selmy. He was extremely courageous, leading the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood and
      outmatching the Smiling Knight in sword combat - the Smiling Knight had previously defeated a young Jaime
      Lannister
      and was considered a terrifying opponent, making Arthur's defeat of him impressive. He is remembered as an
      excellent
      swordsman, and when he finally appears when Bran Stark wargs to the confrontation at the Tower of Joy, he is shown
      to be an incredibly skilled warrior, wielding two swords expertly and cleaving through nearly every opponent he
      faced; the Three-Eyed Raven pointed out that Arthur was vastly superior to Eddard Stark, and the only reason that
      he
      lost was because he was blindsided by Howland Reed.<br><br>

      Ser Arthur's reputation was such that, when people remembered him, it was with acclaim. Years later, Eddard Stark
      would comment that Ser Arthur Dayne was the best warrior Ned had ever encountered. Even when they outnumbered him,
      Ned and his companions were extremely wary about how to approach him, showing that Arthur's skill and reputation
      frightened them. In addition, Arthur was extremely loyal, to a fault, to Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, stating very
      matter-of-factly that the only reason he and Ser Gerold did not fight on the Trident was because Rhaegar ordered
      them to remain at the tower. Even after the deaths of Rhaegar and Aerys, he continued to follow Rhaegar's orders
      to
      protect the pregnant Lyanna Stark, even if that meant killing her brother Eddard. Although this probably had to do
      mostly with his vows, it could have also had something to do with the fact that Rhaegar's great-grandmother, Queen
      Dyanna, was born a Dayne, which could have in turn made Rhaegar and his children, including Jon, kin of some sort
      to
      Ser Arthur. Not much else is known about Ser Arthur, but he is shown to be extremely gentlemanly and polite in
      Bran's vision, greeting his father by title and even wishing him "good fortune in the wars to come"; a hint that
      despite his skills as a swordsman, even he sometimes, if not always, considered the possibility of losing before
      fighting someone else to the death. This also suggests that Arthur did not fear death as evidenced by the fact
      that
      he didn't beg for his life when Howland Reed wounded him. Instead, he simply faced Ned down before the latter
      finished him off.<br><br>

      Quotes

      prince?
      "
      Arthur Dayne: "Our prince wanted us here."
      — Arthur Dayne and Eddard Stark talking about Rhaegar Targaryen[src]

      ―Arthur Dayne to Eddard Stark[src]
      "Then you shall have it."
      ―Arthur Dayne's response to the Smiling Knight's request to wield Dawn, after which he slew the mad outlaw with
      the
      sword.[src]
      Spoken about Arthur

      Knight in single combat."
      ―King Joffrey Baratheon[src]



      Bran Stark: "He's better than my father."
      Three-Eyed Raven: "Far better."
      Bran Stark: "My father beat him."
      Three-Eyed Raven: "Did he?"
      Bran Stark: "I know he did. I heard the story a thousand times."
      — Bran Stark and the Three-Eyed Raven discuss Ser Arthur.[src]
      "Ser Arthur Dayne died the greatest knight who ever lived. After Robert's coronation, I returned Dawn to Starfall.
      One day, House Dayne will raise a worthy successor to Ser Arthur."
      ―Eddard Stark[src]
      Behind the scenes
      In order to keep the Tower of Joy scene a secret during production, Luke Roberts was announced as playing Lord
      "Rowland Selwyn" instead of Arthur Dayne - apparently an amalgamation of the names of Howland Reed and Selwyn
      Tarth,
      Brienne's father.
      In the novels, Dawn is a Greatsword similar to Ice, which Ser Arthur wields with both hands, whereas in the show,
      it
      is portrayed as a longsword which can be wielded alongside a second blade in the off-hand. There is no mention in
      the novels that Ser Arthur ever used Dawn in this fashion. With no desire to narrate a lengthy exposition on Dawn
      and the Sword of the Morning, this change was likely made to enhance the abilities of Ser Arthur, since dual
      wielding is a popular technique in fantasy RPGs. In real life, dual wielding is actually quite difficult, unless
      the
      blades are both relatively short, or one blade is long and the other very short (in which case it is usually a
      specially designed parrying dagger). Again, this draws attention to Ser Arthur's prowess.
      In "The Iron Throne", Ser Arthur's passage in The Book of Brothers erroneously states that he is the third son of
      Lord Symon of House Gaunt, contradicting previously established canon wherein he is the second son of Lord Beric
      Dayne.
      In the books
      In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Arthur Dayne was a knight who had achieved legendary status by the time
      the events of the books take place. Dayne wielded the greatsword Dawn, a blade said to have been forged from metal
      from the heart of a fallen star, and bore the title of "the Sword of the Morning" (he is never stated to have
      wielded two swords, as portrayed in the TV series). He was a close friend of Prince Rhaegar Targaryen.
      <br><br>
      It was Arthur Dayne who knighted Jaime Lannister as a reward for his valor at the battle against the Kingswood
      Brotherhood. Dayne himself slew an infamous member of the Brotherhood, a fearsome swordsman known as the Smiling
      Knight, in single combat. During a spectacular duel, the Smiling Knight's sword was damaged, and Dayne backed off
      to
      allow his foe to take a new weapon. The Smiling Knight remarked that he really wanted Dayne's own sword, to which
      Dayne replied, "then you shall have it, Ser." When the fight resumed, Dayne killed him. Jaime would remember that
      when Ser Arthur Dayne fought with Dawn in hand, he was unstoppable, even though the Smiling Knight was an
      extraordinary foe. He considered Arthur, much like the rest of the Kingsguard of his youth, to be a good man.
      <br><br>
      Arthur Dayne is remembered as the greatest knight of his generation, not only in martial skill but in value and
      virtue as a true knight. Even Barristan Selmy, a living legend in his own right, thought that Ser Arthur surpassed
      himself in all respects. Ser Barristan, Jaime Lannister, and even Eddard Stark were all in awe of Ser Arthur, and
      recall him with nothing less than complete reverence. Jaime tells Loras Tyrell (a member of the Kingsguard in the
      books) that Dayne "could have slain all five of you with his left hand while he was taking a piss with the right".
      The fact that Arthur Dayne used to stand by and do nothing while the Mad King performed his atrocities did not
      taint
      his reputation at all.
      <br><br>
      When Rhaegar's apparent abduction of Lyanna Stark helped provoke Robert's Rebellion, he left Dayne and his fellow
      Kingsguard, Gerold Hightower and Oswell Whent, to guard Lyanna at the Tower of Joy in Dorne. After the Battle of
      the
      Trident, Eddard Stark and six companions arrived at the Tower to rescue her, and were confronted by the three
      Kingsguard, who refused to yield. Only Eddard and his friend Howland Reed survived the battle that followed - both
      Hightower, Whent and Dayne were climactically killed, but it is never explicitly stated how. Bran Stark recalled
      his
      father telling him that Dayne would have killed him if not for Howland Reed, hinting that Reed was heavily
      involved
      in Dayne's defeat. As a mark of respect, Eddard returned Dayne's famous sword to his relatives at Starfall.
      <br><br>
      When asked who would win in a duel, George R.R. Martin said that if Arthur Dayne and Barristan Selmy fought with
      equivalent weaponry it would be a very even fight - but if Dayne was armed with his sword Dawn, he would have the
      advantage over Selmy.[6]
      <br><br>
      House Dayne is a Dornish House, but it is not incongruent that in the TV series he does not have the
      "Mediterranean"
      ethnic appearance of the Martells. When the Rhoynar people migrated to Dorne they settled primarily in the eastern
      river valleys, resulting in different subtypes of Dornishmen. The Martells are "Salty Dornishmen" from the eastern
      coasts, with large amounts of Rhoynar blood in their ancestry. In contrast, the Daynes are "Stony Dornishmen",
      whose
      holdings are in the Red Mountains along the western border of Dorne - and are known for having violet eyes despite
      not being of Valyrian descent. The Rhoynar barely settled in the more isolated mountains of the west, and thus
      Stony
      Dornishmen such as the Daynes are primarily the same First Men/Andal mix as the rest of Westeros.<br>
